### Work in Progress
This is a work in progress. Any contributions, ideas, and feedback are greatly appreciated

### rust.io
This project has not yet been published to rust.io for various reasons:
- a program with the name rat already exists
- this is only a practice project and has no serious purpose

#### Current Features
- number: number output lines
- show-ends: mark the end of each line with $
- number-nonblank: number nonsblank output lines
- squeeze-blank: remove consequtive output lines

#### Current Issues
- doesn't support piping yet
- might consider moving Args to options file


#### TODO
- Other cat features
- Add support for taking stdin (piping)
