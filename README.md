# rat
A basic cat implementation written in rust
### WORK IN PROGRESS
This is a work in progress. Any contributions, ideas, and feedback are greatly appreciated

### TODO
- Greatly improve argument parsing (create a new library just for that)
- Add support for argument flags
- Make code cleaner/more efficient (currently fairly poorly written)
